# Egardia/Woonveilig Hacs component

This component is a rewrite of the standard supported egardia alarmpanel.
The servermode did not work with my GATE-03 device (did not receive the codes).
The GATE-03 can be queried using http, so this plugin uses polling for alarm status.

This repository is initialized from the HACS blueprint repository.
